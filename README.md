* I look into some measurable components of a fastball to determine which, if any, affect a pitcher's fastball whiff percent. This project combines my nearly decade long interest in baseball with linear modeling methods learned in class.
* Methods and criteria included in this paper: Partial F-tests, variance stabilizing transformations, and weighted least squares to develop models; Cook's distance, leverage, and VIF to check models; BIC and corrected AIC to select models; and comparing training versus validation datasets to validate models.
